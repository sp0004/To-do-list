# To-do-list
I am in the process of building an all-in-one list with some additional functionalities
There are three components 
1. To-do list that takes care of the task ( in progress)
2. Money manager ( which tracks your expenses and lets you scan your receipts)
3.  Journal ( we need some ways to dump our thoughts, why not do it in the same )
This is a basic to-do list which is built using the following platform
1. Vite as the frontend package module
How to create Vite project:  npm create vite@latest 
  cd to-do-list
  npm install
  npm run dev 
2. http://localhost:5173/ is where the app is present
3. I am using material UI for the design

===== Running the modules =====
1. Do cd Frontend
2. run npm run dev 
3.  http://localhost:5173/
